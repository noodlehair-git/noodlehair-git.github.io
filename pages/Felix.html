Fuck, I wanna see you. 
<br>
<br>

<strong>08.31.2023:</strong>
I'm sorry. I've just been so mad about this and I don't even have the right to be. I'm sorry. 
<br>
<br>
Idk. Its hard to explain. Rest kept aside, but I just felt a little bad maybe. 
When you have the whole world wanting to talk to you except the love of your life. 
Maybe its a cultural difference idk. Its a midnight thing for us. I literally celebrated at every time zone, based on wherever people were at that point. 
Its hard to believe that you didn't even have a couple of mins. Like I said, idk, I'm just different maybe. I guess you don't get everything in life, and I have accepted that fact. 
<br>
But, its not like we're in a relationship or anything, so I don't have the right. 
<br>
<br>
  
<strong>08.30.2023:</strong>
Thank you for the present. It was really special. The second best thing I could get (after a chance to talk to you).
<br>

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars<br>
I'm gonna give you my heart<br>
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars<br>
'Cause you light up the path<br>
I don't care, go on and tear me apart<br>
I don't care if you do,<br>
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars<br>
I think I saw you!&#10024;
<br>
<br>

(not sure why FindMy throws me out.)
<br>
<br>
Haven't told you in a while, but you're just too cute. 
<br>
<br>

<strong>08.24.2023:</strong>
You can't imagine how much I am missing you rn. 
<br>
<br>
  
Ich kann nicht ohne dich leben, mein Marillenknödel!

Fel, I’m still thinking of how to put <i>me seeing you today</i> into words. 
Umm, a lot better feeling than when I stepped out of the house without a facemask post pandemic (weird analogy). 
But hey, it felt like I could finally breathe and my life is back, so relatable? Guessing you are my Oxygen!?
<br>
But honestly, no, I cannot put the feeling into words, Fel (I was so emotional that even my voice was cracking). 
My heart melted when I finally heard your voice, heard you say all those things that I absolutely loved listening to. 
<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/Vs_lVOPZMAM?si=RRtcxW0kyhT-Ammf">*Whenever I see you*</a>
<br>
And please please please, don’t apologize to me (and don’t apologize for apologizing). 
I understand really. 
Whatever you need, whenever you need. 
Out of everyone in life, know for a fact, you can never hurt me (I just have a tendency to go into my shell when I am low and I try to block <i>everything</i> and I didn't see your updates, which honestly is something I thrive on). 
<br>
<br>
Your dedication and hard work on your thesis are truly admirable. 
Keep pushing forward, and remember that your efforts will yield a remarkable achievement that reflects your brilliance (blue-y-ance). 
<br>
And I have confidence that you’ll excel! 
Anticipating witnessing your remarkable achievements, Fel! 
If you ever want to talk about that, I'm there, always (for other things too, but this specifically. I know how much it means to you.)
<br>
Love ya mostest. Until next time! 
<br>
Schatz
<br>
<br>
  
<strong>08.22.2023:</strong>
It was just for a bit, Fel. But yeah, I get it. 
I'm sorry.
Won't bother you. All the best with your thesis. 
I'm sure you'll nail it. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>08.21.2023:</strong>
Oka! Lemme know whatever time works for you! :) 
<br>
Waiting too, for you to have some time hopefully. 
<br>
Right. Looking foward to seeing you (at least virtually) sometime. 
<br>
Will I ever get to see you...
<br>
<br>

<strong>08.19.2023:</strong>
Not sure what makes you not reply on WhatsApp but here. 
Whatever works for you. But, really, I am okay. I am doing much better now, keeping myself occupied with things. Heartbreak takes time to heal so I am just giving it time to be somewhat normal again...to probably smile again someday. 
Reading a lot about it these days. New to this stuff. 
Yes, things would never be the same. 
I would never be the same. I know that the pain would never go away. 
At least I know this for sure, I would never fall in love again. 
This was it. 
<br>
<br>
I hope you are doing okay, though. 
<br>
<br>
  
<strong>08.18.2023:</strong>
I am all fine, Fel. Don't worry:) 
<br>
<br>
Let it go!
<br>
<br>

<strong>08.17.2023:</strong>
Mehr! I am here if you ever want to talk.  
Heads up, I am really not what I used to be. 
<br>
<br>

Well, lmk whenever you receive them. 
<br>
<br>
Tried to support a Ukrainian small business. I remember you wanting to make a difference.

<br>
<br>
  
You created the bot, how would that fail? I was not in a state. 
Like I said, stuff blew up. 
<br> <br> 
But, its been a while since someone said <i>Hey there!; Schatz; You're amazing; 
Do you realize how cute you are?; Say my name; I love you;</i> and fulfilled the day's quota. 
Its been a while since I last smiled, since I last got a chance to just stare at you and look into your eyes.

Fel, how are you? 

<br>

<br>
Do you think I really need to answer this: <i>How are you Schatz?</i> Let's just say that I am still alive and I have never felt a pain like this ever before. 
<br>
<br>
Things blew up on my end. 
<br>
I know I went in too hard this time, removing you from FindMy and whatnot. Not even realizing that it won't change a thing. And yes, it kills me every moment. Also, <i>just know that my feelings for you haven't changed, and never will</i> and they will only get stronger. You are my everything, Fel, everything. You are my soulmate, my vanilla, my squishy, my tea-rex. I miss seeing you, your eyes, your awkward jokes, listening to you talk on and on, your voice. I miss being loved, Fel. Can't believe that I am saying this, but I constantly miss someone advertising EU to me. My yesterday's wallpaper was a picture from Austria. Never have I ever had a breakdown looking at a wallpaper. I just find you in every damn thing, Fel. I am not even kidding. 
<br>
<br>
I don't know what I am doing with my life, really, putting you through so much. You are all allowed to hate me for this, Fel. I accept it and I won't even complain. 
<br>
I am always there for you, Fel! Immer! Immer! 
No matter what! I am really just a call away and trust me, I'll be there whenever you need me.  
<br>
Every word, every message that I ever sent you came straight from my heart. 
Without thinking of any practicalities, I jumped straight into it and made you suffer. I am sorry, Fel. But know that my love for you was, is, and always will be pure and I will always be your <i>Schatz</i> (I learned German capitalization rules; weird capitals all over the sentence used to give me OCD). Don't you dare call anyone that. I am possessive about certain things&#128149;! 
<br>
<br>
I want to stay in touch with you too, Fel. You are my soulmate, the love of my life. I see every update of yours. And you know what, I don't even need a bot to notify me. I still see when you mess up the indent or improvise on the message. This time I was too broken to even reply and I know that would have made you feel worse. I am sorry. That won't happen again.
<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/eitDnP0_83k">I will never be the same again! *Click me*</a>
<br>
<br>
(That was the first <i>Click me</i> that I knew wasn't a phishing link and I clicked on it. Look at how much I trust you...SSN, pins, and even random links. 
Should I even work in security anymore?) 
<br>
<br>

Goodbye Fel. Take Care! 
Ich werde dich immer immer immer lieben. Du wirst immer die Liebe meines Lebens sein. Und ich werde immer Dein Schatz sein.
<br>
<br>

  
<strong>08.09.2023:</strong>
It kills me that I am putting you through so much pain.

Glaube mehr an dich als ich an mich selbst glaube.

Wenn du jemals reden möchtest, bin ich nur eine SMS/einen Anruf entfernt. Ich bin immer für dich da, Fel. Stets.
<br>
<br>
  
<strong>06.30.2023:</strong>
Ich versuche weiterzumachen, Fel.
Es ist schwer, es ist wirklich sehr, sehr schwer. Aber ich versuche. Ja, ich will alles hören. Ja ich vermisse dich. Und ja, ich liebe dich (mehr).

<i>When you try your best, but you don't succeed;
When you get what you want, but not what you need;
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep;
Stuck in reverse...
And the tears come streaming down your face;
When you lose something you can't replace;
When you love someone, but it goes to waste;
Could it be worse?&#127925;</i>
