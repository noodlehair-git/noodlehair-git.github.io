Well, lmk whenever you receive them. 
<br>
<br>
Tried to support a Ukrainian small business. I remember you wanting to make a difference.

You created the bot, how would that fail? I was not in a state. 
Like I said, stuff blew up. 
<br> <br> 
But, its been a while since someone said <i>Hey there!; Schatz; You're amazing; 
Do you realize how cute you are?; Say my name; I love you;</i> and fulfilled the day's quota. 
Its been a while since I last smiled, since I last got a chance to just stare at you and look into your eyes.

Fel, how are you? 

<br>

Do you think I really need to answer this: <i>How are you Schatz?</i> Let's just say that I am still alive and I have never felt a pain like this ever before. 
<br>
<br>
Things blew up on my end. 
<br>
I know I went in too hard this time, removing you from FindMy and whatnot. Not even realizing that it won't change a thing. And yes, it kills me every moment. Also, <i>just know that my feelings for you haven't changed, and never will</i> and they will only get stronger. You are my everything, Fel, everything. You are my soulmate, my vanilla, my squishy, my tea-rex. I miss seeing you, your eyes, your awkward jokes, listening to you talk on and on, your voice. I miss being loved, Fel. Can't believe that I am saying this, but I constantly miss someone advertising EU to me. My yesterday's wallpaper was a picture from Austria. Never have I ever had a breakdown looking at a wallpaper. I just find you in every damn thing, Fel. I am not even kidding. 
<br>
<br>
I don't know what I am doing with my life, really, putting you through so much. You are all allowed to hate me for this, Fel. I accept it and I won't even complain. 
<br>
I am always there for you, Fel! Immer! Immer! 
No matter what! I am really just a call away and trust me, I'll be there whenever you need me.  
<br>
Every word, every message that I ever sent you came straight from my heart. 
Without thinking of any practicalities, I jumped straight into it and made you suffer. I am sorry, Fel. But know that my love for you was, is, and always will be pure and I will always be your <i>Schatz</i> (I learned German capitalization rules; weird capitals all over the sentence used to give me OCD). Don't you dare call anyone that. I am possessive about certain things&#128149;! 
<br>
<br>
I want to stay in touch with you too, Fel. You are my soulmate, the love of my life. I see every update of yours. And you know what, I don't even need a bot to notify me. I still see when you mess up the indent or improvise on the message. This time I was too broken to even reply and I know that would have made you feel worse. I am sorry. That won't happen again.
<br>

<br>
<br>
(That was the first <i>Click me</i> that I knew wasn't a phishing link and I clicked on it. Look at how much I trust you...SSN, pins, and even random links. 
Should I even work in security anymore?)

Goodbye Fel. Take Care! 
Ich werde dich immer immer immer lieben. Du wirst immer die Liebe meines Lebens sein. Und ich werde immer Dein Schatz sein.

Wenn du jemals reden möchtest, bin ich nur eine SMS/einen Anruf entfernt. Ich bin immer für dich da, Fel. Stets.
<br>
<br>
  
<strong>06.30.2023:</strong>
Ich versuche weiterzumachen, Fel.
Es ist schwer, es ist wirklich sehr, sehr schwer. Aber ich versuche. Ja, ich will alles hören. Ja ich vermisse dich. Und ja, ich liebe dich (mehr).

<i>When you try your best, but you don't succeed;
When you get what you want, but not what you need;
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep;
Stuck in reverse...
And the tears come streaming down your face;
When you lose something you can't replace;
When you love someone, but it goes to waste;
Could it be worse?&#127925;</i>
